# Text_Summarization

Auto_Text_Summarization. Jumping through tons of pages can be challenging and time consuming. This model will extract sentences from the long text documents and determines which are the most important. Finally, returns the relevant text in a readable and structured way. It saves plenty of valuable time!

There are 3 main types of Auto-summarization:

1.	Extraction-based summarization.
2.	Abstraction-based summarization
3.	Aided summarization

We will be using "Extraction-based summarization" in for this model.

Evaluation Techniques:

Most Challenging part of any ML Model is: Evaluation. For better evaluation it is good to compare the auto-summaries with human-made model summaries.

There are following different ways for evaluation:

1.	Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation
2.	Inter-textual and intra-textual
3.	Domain specific vs domain independent summarization
4.	Evaluating summaries qualitatively
